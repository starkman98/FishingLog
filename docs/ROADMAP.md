# FishingLog Roadmap

## Guiding Principles
- **Offline-first**: Local SQLite is the source of truth on device until synced
- **Server is system of record**: API + PostgreSQL is the canonical source across devices
- **Explicit sync**: Dirty flags + last sync cursor pattern
- **Responsive UI**: async/await everywhere, no blocking calls
- **Incremental delivery**: Ship working features in small, testable increments

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 2 Success**: User can track individual catches with species, weight, and photos
- **Phase 3 Success**: Trips are automatically enriched with weather and moon phase
- **Phase 5 Success**: Multiple users can securely access their own data
- **Phase 6 Success**: Users can collaborate on shared fishing trips within teams
- **Production Success**: 100+ active users, <1% crash rate, 99.9% API uptime

## Notes

- Each phase should be shippable independently
- Prioritize user feedback after MVP
- Keep security top-of-mind from the start
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Celebrate small wins! 🎣
