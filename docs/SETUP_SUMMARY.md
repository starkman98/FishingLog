## 🔧 Configuration Overview

### API Configuration (ASP.NET Core Standard)

**Development** (`appsettings.Development.json`):
```
Database: localhost:5432/fishinglog_dev
Logging: Debug level with EF Core SQL queries
CORS: Allows localhost origins
```

**Usage**: Automatically loaded when `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`

### Mobile Configuration (Custom Implementation)

**Development** (`appsettings.Development.json`):
```
API Base URL: https://localhost:5001
Sync: Disabled on startup, 5-minute intervals
Database: fishinglog_dev.db3
Logging: Debug level
```

**Production** (`appsettings.json`):
```
API Base URL: https://localhost:5001 (will be changed to production URL later)
Sync: Enabled on startup, 15-minute intervals
Database: fishinglog.db3
```

**Usage**: Files are embedded as resources and loaded based on build configuration:
- `#if DEBUG` → loads `appsettings.Development.json`
- `#if RELEASE` → loads `appsettings.json`

6. **Follow the checklist** to verify your environment
7. **Use quick reference** for common commands

### 📋 Roadmap Updated:
- [x] Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL
- [x] API appsettings.Development.json with connection strings
- [x] Mobile appsettings.json with API base URL
- [x] README.md with setup instructions
- [x] .gitignore properly configured

### ⏭️ Next Steps (from Roadmap):
- [ ] User secrets configuration for sensitive data (optional for now)
- [ ] **Domain**: `FishingTrip` entity
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: DbContext setup for PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Initial EF Core migration

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### For New Developers:
1. Start with `docs/SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` to verify your environment
2. Read `docs/QUICK_START.md` for common commands
3. Reference `docs/MOBILE_CONFIGURATION.md` when working with mobile settings
4. Follow `README.md` for comprehensive setup

### For Configuration Changes:
- **API**: Edit `src/FishingLog.Api/appsettings.Development.json`
- **Mobile (Debug)**: Edit `src/FishingLog.Mobile/appsettings.Development.json`
- **Mobile (Release)**: Edit `src/FishingLog.Mobile/appsettings.json`

**Remember**: Mobile config files are embedded at compile time, so you must rebuild after changes!
